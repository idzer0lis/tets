              the relevant transaction being included in a block on the Ethereum
              blockchain which has received such number of confirmations as the

              purposes (regardless of any notice of any trust or any other interest,
              or the theft or loss of any private key) and neither the Company nor any

            <p>The Company has imposed a minimum aggregate contribution target of USD
              $10,000,000 to be reached at the conclusion of the Token Sale,
              including any earlier or private sales (the “<strong>Minimum Target</strong>”). If on
              conclusion of the Token Sale, the Company has not received the Minimum
              Target calculated in accordance with clause 10.3, the Company may, at
              its discretion, procure that some or all contributions are returned to
              contributors, subject to clause 10.2.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>You accept any contribution that may, at the Company’s discretion, be

              in the transfer of ETH as a transaction cost for using the Ethereum
              network), transaction fees, costs, charges or other expenses the Company
              has incurred or reasonably expects to incur (whether or not directly
              attributable to your contribution or such return). For the avoidance of
              doubt, no interest will accrue on the value of any contribution,
              including any contribution which is in fact returned. You acknowledge
              and agree that you are unlikely to receive an amount equivalent to your
              contribution by way of a refund and that such refunded amount may be
              significantly lower than the amount contributed by you and it could be
              nil.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>For the purposes of calculating the amount that all contributions made
              before and during the Contribution Period bears against the Minimum
              Target, the Company will on the conclusion of the Token Sale (the
              “<strong>Sale Closure</strong>”), calculate the aggregate of all contributions made
              before and during the Contribution Period using a methodology it
              considers appropriate.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The Company reserves the right to refuse or reject any contributions
              made at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. To the extent that
              we refuse or reject a contribution, we will exercise reasonable
              endeavours to procure that the contribution is returned to the
              Contributor to the Ethereum wallet, or to the bank account from which
              the contribution was made (as the case may be), subject to clause 10.2.
              However, we do not warrant, represent or offer any assurances that we
              will successfully be able to recover and/or return any such

          <li>
            <p>During any period of suspension or in the event that the Token Sale is

              the Token Sale has been suspended or aborted in accordance with clause
              10.6) risk losing their entire contribution and we will not be

        <p><strong>Audit of the Smart Contract System</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The Company will exercise reasonable endeavours to have the Smart
              Contract System audited and approved by technical experts with regard to
              both accuracy and security of the underlying code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Notwithstanding clause 14.1, smart contract technology is still in an
              early stage of development and its application is currently of an
              experimental nature, which carries significant operational,
              technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.
              Accordingly, while any audit conducted may raise the level of security
              and accuracy of the Smart Contract System, you acknowledge, understand
              and accept that the audit does not amount to any form of warranty,
              representation or assurance (in each case whether express or implied)
              that the Smart Contract System and RKT are fit for a particular purpose
              or that they are free from any defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities,
              viruses or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH
              contributions and/or RKT.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>You are responsible for implementing all reasonable and appropriate
              measures for securing the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism you
              use to send a contribution to the Company and to receive and store RKT
              that are issued to you by the Smart Contract System, including any
              requisite private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such
              storage mechanism(s). If your private key(s) or other access credentials
              are lost, you may lose access to your RKT. The Company is not
              responsible for any security measures relating to your receipt,
              possession, storage, transfer or potential future use of RKT nor will we
              be under any obligation to recover or return any RKT.</p>

          <li>
            <p>The Company excludes (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable

              omissions which result in your loss of (including your loss of access
              to) RKT issued to you.</p>

        PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER,
        WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS CLAUSE REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE
        CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH THE COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH
        YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions,
          causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) in
          which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the
          alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without
          limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or
          patents, you and the Company (i) waive your and the Company’s respective
          rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these T&amp;Cs
          resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and the Company’s respective rights
          to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company agree to arbitrate Disputes
          through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or
          more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
          binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by
          a judge or jury in court).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</strong>. Any
          Dispute arising out of or related to these T&amp;Cs is personal to you and the
          Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will
          not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
          representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration
          in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of
          another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be
          brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or
          outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
          individuals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>. The enforceability of this clause 26 will be both
          substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in
          accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration,
          to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>. Each Party will notify the other
          Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it
          arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute
          informally. Notice to the Company must be sent by e-mail to the Company at
          <a href="mailto:disputes@gbx.gi">disputes@gbx.gi</a>. Notice to you will be sent to any address you provide to
          us in writing in a notice. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal
          address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in
          reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the
          specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Company cannot agree
          how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date that the
          notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or the Company
          may, as appropriate and in accordance with this clause 26, commence an
          arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in clause
          26, file a claim in court.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Process</strong>. Any arbitration will occur in Gibraltar. The arbitration will
          be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator appointed by the
          Gibraltar Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the rules of the
          International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, which are hereby
          incorporated by reference. The courts located in Gibraltar will have
          exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
          arbitration decision.</p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong>. These T&amp;Cs, the applicable International
          Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and the arbitrator will have (i)
          the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and
          substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of
          whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy
          that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the
          arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a
          representative or class action, which is prohibited by these T&amp;Cs. The
          arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not
          consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of
          class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
          more than one individual.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

          the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration are unfair or
          should not apply for any reason.</p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions</strong>. If any
          term, clause or provision of this clause 26 is held invalid or
          unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and
          required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this clause
          26 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in
          clause 26.2 above are severable from the other provisions of these T&amp;Cs and

              official Smart Contract System and to run a new version of the Smart

              to make any essential corrections, or as may be otherwise required by
              any laws or regulatory requirements to which we are subject. If we make
              any amendments to these T&amp;Cs, we will publish a notice together with the

              provision will be severable from these T&amp;Cs without affecting the
              validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or

        <p><strong>SCHEDULE 3</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>RISK FACTORS</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS NOT NOR IS IT INTENDED TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE OR
        EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF RISK FACTORS</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of software weaknesses</strong>: because RKT, the Smart Contract System and
          the GBX Platform are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction,
          breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material
          adverse effect on RKT, the Smart Contract System and/or the GBX Platform.
          Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
          development of quantum computing, could present risks to the RKT (including
          the utility of RKT for obtaining services), the Smart Contract System and/or
          the GBX Platform, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus
          mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. The Smart Contract System
          concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
          Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven.
          There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating RKT will be
          uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the
          software could contain defects, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, viruses or bugs
          causing, inter alia, the complete loss of contributions and/or RKT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Regulatory risk</strong>: blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction
          and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing
          regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain
          technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of
          the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial
          modifications to the Smart Contract System and/or the GBX Platform,
          including its termination and the loss of RKT for the Contributor.
          Additionally, regulation of proposed activities of the GBX Platform is
          currently uncertain. It is not known what regulatory framework the proposed
          GBX Platform and associated activities will be subject to, the nature and
          obligations that will be imposed on the Company in order to comply with any
          such regulatory framework or when/if the Company will even be able to apply
          to be regulated, or successfully obtain the necessary licences so that it
          may lawfully carry out its proposed business activities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions</strong>: the
          regulatory status of RKT and distributed ledger technology is unclear or
          unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether
          regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such
          technology and its applications, including specifically (but without
          limitation to) the GBX Platform and RKT. It is likewise difficult to predict
          how or whether any legislative or regulatory authorities may implement
          changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and
          its applications, including specifically (but without limitation to) the GBX
          Platform and RKT. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the GBX
          Platform and RKT in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration
          only, through a determination that RKT are a regulated financial instrument
          that requires registration or licensing. The Company may cease operations in
          a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or
          regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
          undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in
          such jurisdiction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of abandonment / lack of success / business failure</strong>: the creation
          and issue of RKT and the development of the GBX Platform may be abandoned,
          may suffer from lack of success and may suffer business failure for a number
          of reasons including but not limited to, lack of interest from the public,
          lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by
          competing projects). There is no assurance that, even if any such GBX
          Platform is partially or fully developed and launched, you will receive any
          benefits through RKT that you hold.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk associated with other applications</strong>: the GBX Platform may give rise
          to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties,
          under which RKT will have no intrinsic value. This means that competitors
          may produce platforms that compete with the GBX Platform and may not accept
          RKT as payment for services within such platforms; further, such platforms
          may become more popular and have greater success than the GBX Platform. In
          addition, the utility of RKT depends on the success of the GBX Platform, if
          developed. The GBX Platform may not be popular or widely used after it is
          launched. In the long term, the GBX Platform may fail to attract a critical
          mass of users. The GBX Platform may be merged with other projects. Various
          circumstances, including technical advancement and competitors, may render
          the GBX Platform obsolete.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks associated with markets for RKT</strong>: the Company may choose not to
          enable or otherwise facilitate any secondary speculative trading or any such
          external valuation of RKT. This may restrict the contemplated avenues for
          using RKT to the token utility described in the GBX Whitepaper and could
          therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to any RKT you own. Even if
          secondary trading of RKT is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such
          exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory
          oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.
          Furthermore, to the extent that any third party ascribes an external
          exchange value to RKT (e.g. as denominated in a crypto or fiat currency),
          such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. If you are
          purchasing the RKT as a form of investment on a speculative basis or
          otherwise, or for a financial purpose, with the expectation or desire that
          their inherent, intrinsic or cash-equivalent value may increase with time,
          you assume all risks associated with such speculation or actions, and any
          errors associated therewith, and accept that the RKT are not offered by the
          Company or its affiliates on an investment basis. You further acknowledge
          that any contribution that you make under these T&amp;Cs (or you consider to be
          invested in the Company) will not be protected, guaranteed or reimbursed by
          any governmental, regulatory or other entity, and will not, for instance be
          guaranteed by the Gibraltar Deposit Guarantee Scheme, the Gibraltar Investor
          Compensation Scheme, and is unlikely to be protected by any equivalent
          scheme in a jurisdiction outside of Gibraltar.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of losing access to tokens due to loss of private key(s), custodial
          error or your error</strong>: RKT can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet
          with a combination of the Contributor’s account information (address),
          private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. You
          acknowledge, understand and accept that if your private key or password gets
          lost or stolen, the obtained RKT associated with your Ethereum wallet
          address may be unrecoverable and permanently lost. Additionally, any third
          party that gains access to your private key, including by gaining access to
          the login credentials relating to your Ethereum wallet, may be able to
          misappropriate your RKT. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise
          related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store RKT,
          including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet
          or vault, may also result in the loss of your RKT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of theft and vulnerabilities</strong>: the Smart Contract System concept,
          the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum
          blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals
          including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
          consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such
          successful attacks could result in theft or loss of contributions or RKT,
          adversely impacting the ability to develop the GBX Platform and derive any
          usage or functionality from RKT. You must take appropriate steps to satisfy
          yourself of the integrity and veracity of relevant websites, systems and
          communications. Furthermore, because the GBX Platform is based on
          open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the
          Company’s team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or
          defects into the core infrastructure of the GBX Platform, which could
          negatively affect the GBX Platform and RKT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of Ethereum mining attacks</strong>: as with other cryptocurrencies, the
          blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining
          attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining
          power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and rare condition attacks. Any
          successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected
          proper execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper
          execution and sequencing of contract computations. You understand and accept
          that the network of miners will ultimately be in control of the distribution
          of the RKT via the Smart Contract System, and that a majority of miners
          could agree at any point to make changes, updates, modifications to, or
          effect a deletion or destruction of the Smart Contract System, and that such
          a scenario could lead to the RKT losing intrinsic value and/or
          functionality.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of incompatible wallet service</strong>: the wallet or wallet service
          provider used to receive RKT must to conform to the ERC20 token standard in
          order to be technically compatible with RKT. The failure to ensure such
          conformity may have the result that Contributor will not gain access to his
          RKT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of hard-fork</strong>: the GBX Platform will need to go through substantial
          development works as part of which it may become the subject of significant
          conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the
          development, an upgrade to RKT may be required (hard-fork of RKT) and that,
          if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able
          to use your RKT and any non-upgraded RKT may lose its utility in full.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of uninsured losses</strong>: unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other
          financial institutions, RKT are uninsured unless you specifically obtain
          private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of
          utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by
          us, to offer recourse to you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks arising from taxation</strong>: the tax characterization of RKT is
          uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with acquisition,
          storage, transfer and use of RKT, which may result in adverse tax
          consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes,
          transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes, capital taxes and similar
          taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of an unfavourable fluctuation of Ethereum and other currency
          value</strong>: the Company intends to use the contributions received to fund the
          development of RKT, the GBX Platform and various other operating expenses.
          The contributions received will be denominated in ETH, fiat acceptable to
          the Company, and may be converted into other cryptographic assets and fiat
          currencies. If the value of ETH or other currencies fluctuates unfavourably
          during or after the Token Sale, the Company may not be able to fund the
          development of, or may not be able to maintain, the GBX Platform in the
          manner that it intended.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of dissolution of the Company or network</strong>: it is possible that, due
          to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable
          fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic assets and fiat
          currencies), decrease in RKT utility due to negative adoption of the GBX
          Platform, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property
          ownership challenges, the GBX Platform may no longer be viable to operate
          and the Company may dissolve and may not be able to continue the development
          of the GBX Platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks arising from lack of governance rights</strong>: because RKT confer no
          governance rights of any kind with respect to the GBX Platform or the
          Company; all decisions involving the Company (including to sell or liquidate
          the Company) will be made by the Company acting in its sole and absolute
          discretion, and all decisions involving the GBX Platform including, but not
          limited to, decisions to discontinue the GBX Platform, to create and issue
          more RKT, will be made by the Company. These decisions could adversely
          affect the GBX Platform and/or RKT you hold.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks arising from the market in which the GBX Platform operates</strong>: the
          crypto-currency exchange market, the token listing and trading market, ICOs,
          and by extension the GBX Platform, is subject to a variety of federal, state
          and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to
          KYC/AML and customer due diligence procedures, privacy and data protection,
          consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws and regulations,
          and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could
          change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting the GBX Platform
          could be enacted, which could impact the utility of RKT in the GBX Platform.
          Additionally, GBX Platform users are subject to or may be adversely affected
          by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any
          of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or
          other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or
          licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it
          could adversely impact the GBX Platform and the RKT, including its utility
          to obtain or provide services within the GBX Platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks associated with the development and maintenance of the GBX
          Platform</strong>: the GBX Platform is still under development and may undergo
          significant changes over time. Although we intend for the RKT and GBX
          Platform to function as described in the GBX Whitepaper, and intend to take
          commercially reasonable steps towards those ends, we may have to make
          changes to the specifications of the RKT or the GBX Platform for any number
          of legitimate reasons. Moreover, we may not be able to retain full and
          effective control over how other participants will use the GBX Platform,
          what products or services will be offered through the GBX Platform by third
          parties, or how third-party products and services will utilize RKT (if at
          all). This could create the risk that the RKT or GBX Platform, as further
          developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of
          purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and
          participate in the GBX Platform, it is still possible that the GBX Platform
          will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or
          maintained, which may negatively impact the GBX Platform and RKT, and the
          potential utility of the RKT, including the utility of the RKT for obtaining
          services and/or offering rewards and/or being used in the manner intended at
          the time of the Token Sale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks associated with incomplete information regarding the GBX Platform</strong>:
          you will not have full access to all the information relevant to the Company
          and/or the GBX Platform. The Company is not required to update you on the
          progress of the GBX Platform. You are responsible for making your own
          decision in respect of purchasing RKT. The Company does not provide you with
          any recommendation or advice in respect of the purchase of RKT. You may not
          rely on the Company to provide you with complete or up to date information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of competing platforms</strong>: it is possible that alternative platforms
          could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol
          underlying the GBX Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are
          materially similar to the services offered by or within the GBX Platform.
          The GBX Platform may compete with these alternatives, which could negatively
          impact the GBX Platform and RKT, including the utility of the RKT for
          obtaining services offered by or within the GBX Platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risk of inadequate resources</strong>: the Token Sale and the GBX Platform will
          require intensive computing resources. The demand for these resources may
          exceed the Company’s estimates. Ultimately, the Company’s resources may
          prove inadequate to support the Token Sale and/or develop the GBX Platform,
          which may affect the distribution and/or utility of RKT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Risks associated with third party contractors</strong>: development of RKT and
          the GBX Platform, and the operation of the Token Sale, will require
          third-party contractors with particular expertise in Ethereum and blockchain
          technology. The availability of such contractors is limited. There may not
          be sufficient (or any) such contractors available on terms deemed acceptable
          by the Company. The costs associated with any such contractors may be
          significantly greater than currently estimated. Further, the quality,
          reliability and timely delivery of services by such contractors may vary
          significantly</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Jurisdiction related risks</strong>: residents, tax residents or persons having a
          relevant connection with certain jurisdictions are excluded from the Token
          Sale. Changes in your place of domicile or the applicable law may result in
          you violating any legal or regulatory requirements of your applicable
          jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that the distribution,
          holding, use or exchange of RKT is, and remains lawful despite changes to
          applicable laws, your residence and circumstances.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Unanticipated risks</strong>: cryptographic tokens such as RKT are a new and
          untested technology. In addition to the risks set out in this Schedule 2,
          there are other risks associated with your acquisition, storage, transfer
          and use of RKT, including those that the Company may not be able to
          anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations
          or combinations of the risks set out in this Schedule 2**.**</p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Brexit risk</strong>: Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory. It is part of
          the EU, having joined the European Economic Community with the United
          Kingdom in 1973 by virtue of Article 355(3) (ex Article 299(4)) which
          applies the treaty to ‘the European territories for whose external relations
          a Member State is responsible’, a provision which in practice only applies
          to Gibraltar. By virtue of this, Gibraltar is required to enact all EU
          directives and regulations. The Government of Gibraltar may fail to enact an
          EU directive or regulation or may enact an EU directive or regulation
          erroneously. This could negatively impact on the jurisdiction and
          consequently the Company’s activities.  On 23 June 2016, the UK voted to
          leave the EU and there is a risk that a change to the UK’s status within the
          EU could impact on Gibraltar’s position within the EU, including Gibraltar
          having to assume any new status adopted by the UK.  If Gibraltar’s status
          within the EU changes or if Gibraltar were to leave the EU, this could
          restrict and/or prevent Gibraltar entities (current and future) from
          conducting business with the EU. This could significantly impact upon the
          Company’s activities undertaken from within Gibraltar.</p>
