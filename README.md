# README #

This is the README for the wealthE project

The application is broken down into two separate projects:

* `backoffice-web-app` which covers the back-office user interface and API endpoints for the client-facing website
* `frontend-web-app` which covers the static, API-supported, client-facing website

Each of the two projects has its own README with more specific information.
